## **Acknowledgements**

* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org). We used that codebase as a starting point for PetLog.
* The session feature was inspired by NUS CS2103/T Project Duke's [Level 7](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526-s2.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/projectDuke/index.html#level-7-save) and [Level 8](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526-s2.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/projectDuke/index.html#level-8-dates-and-times). We used a similar approach when handling session date/time inputs.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of app launch and shutdown.
* At app launch, it initialises the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shutdown, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete oi/1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class, which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside components from being coupled to a component's implementation), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="1000"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts, e.g., `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `OwnerListPanel`, `SessionListPanel`, `ServiceListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layouts of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person`, `Pet`, `Session`, and `Service` objects residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="500"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete oi/1")` API call as an example.

<img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000"/>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="800"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, `AddressBookParser` creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name, e.g., `AddOwnerCommandParser`). That parser uses the supporting classes shown above to parse input and create an `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddOwnerCommand`), which `AddressBookParser` returns as a `Command`.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddOwnerCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible, e.g., during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Lower-level details such as owner and pet fields (e.g. `Address`, `Species`) have been omitted from the diagram.

</div>

The `Model` component,

* stores the PetLog data in an `AddressBook`, which contains all `Person` objects in a `UniquePersonList` and all `Service` objects in a `UniqueServiceList`.
* stores each owner's pets inside the corresponding `Person` object. Each `Pet` is made up of its own value objects such as `PetName`, `Species`, and `PetRemark`, and also owns its own list of `Session` objects.
* stores each `Session` as a time range with a fee and a list of associated `Service` objects, allowing one session to reference multiple services recorded in the `AddressBook`.
* stores the currently selected owners as a filtered list, exposed as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>`. This allows the UI to observe owner list changes and update automatically.
* derives and stores a separate filtered pet list, exposed as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Pet>`, so the UI can display pets in addition to the owner cards.
* derives and stores a displayed session list, exposed as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<SessionEntry>`. Each `SessionEntry` bundles a `Session` together with its owner and pet context for the UI.
* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPrefs` object.
* does not depend on the `UI`, `Logic`, or `Storage` components, since the `Model` represents the domain entities and their relationships.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It illustrates how `AddressBook` could store a shared `Tag` list that `Person` objects reference, instead of each `Person` storing its own `Tag` objects. This would reduce duplicate `Tag` instances across owners. For simplicity, the alternative diagram focuses only on the tag-related part of the model and omits the newer `Pet`, `Session`, and `Service` structures.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="700" />

The `Storage` component,
* exposes a unified `Storage` API that extends both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefsStorage`.
* is implemented by `StorageManager`, which delegates to `JsonAddressBookStorage` (PetLog data) and `JsonUserPrefsStorage` (user preferences).
* persists `ReadOnlyAddressBook` as JSON through `JsonSerializableAddressBook`, which uses Jackson-friendly adapters (`JsonAdaptedPerson`, `JsonAdaptedPet`, `JsonAdaptedSession`, `JsonAdaptedService`, `JsonAdaptedTag`) to convert between JSON and model types.
* preserves nested domain data when reading/writing: owners include pets, pets include sessions, and sessions include services; the address book also stores a top-level service list.
* returns `Optional.empty()` when data files are missing, and throws `DataLoadingException` when file contents are malformed or violate model constraints.
* is invoked by `LogicManager` to save the address book after each successful command, while user preferences are loaded/saved during app startup and shutdown in `MainApp`.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

These include indexes, exceptions and utility classes.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Pet management

The pet feature is implemented by extending each `Person` with a `LinkedHashSet<Pet>`.

Key implementation points:
* `AddPetCommand` targets an owner from the current filtered owner list using `oi/`.
* Pet identity is checked per owner via `Person#hasPet(Pet)`, which compares pet name + species after normalisation (case-insensitive, whitespace-normalised).
* On successful `addpet`, the command rebuilds that owner with an updated pet set and applies it through `Model#setPerson(...)`.
* Pet remarks are updated through `update oi/... pi/... pr/...` (`UpdatePetRemarkCommand`), which edits the selected pet and writes the owner back via `Model#setPerson(...)`.
* The model also maintains a derived filtered pet list (`Model#getFilteredPetList`) so the UI can render pets directly without recalculating from owners.

The sequence diagram below shows the main interaction flow for a successful `addpet` operation.

<img src="images/PetManagementSequenceDiagram.png" width="700" />
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddPetCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

### Service catalogue

Services are stored as a top-level catalogue in `AddressBook` via `UniqueServiceList`.

Key implementation points:
* `addservice` validates service name/price through `ParserUtil` and `Service` constraints, then adds the service via `Model#addService(...)`.
* Service uniqueness is identity-based by normalised name (`Service#isSameService` / `Service#hasSameName`), so case/spacing variants are treated as duplicates.
* Price validation accepts only values from `0` to `10000` with up to 2 decimal places.
* `delete sn/...` removes a service by normalised name, and rejects mixed delete modes (e.g., owner index + service name in one command) at parser level.

### Session scheduling

Sessions are attached to pets (not stored as a top-level list), and each `Session` stores:
* a strict start time/end time (`yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`)
* a computed total fee
* an immutable list of selected services

Key implementation points:
* `addsession` resolves owner (`oi/`) and pet (`pi/`) from the current filtered owner list.
* Date/time parsing is strict (`Session#parseDateTime`), and end time must be after start time.
* Optional repeated `sn/` prefixes are allowed to attach multiple services from the service catalogue.
* Total session fee is computed from the sum of selected service prices.
* Overlap prevention is enforced per pet via `Pet#hasOverlappingSession(...)`; sessions that only touch at boundaries are allowed.
* `delete oi/... pi/... si/...` removes a session by index within that pet’s session list.
* The UI-facing session list is a derived projection (`SessionEntry`) rebuilt by `Model#updateDisplayedSessions(...)`, so `list`, `find`, `addsession`, and relevant `delete` operations keep the session panel synchronised with the current owner filter.

Design note:
* Existing sessions keep their own service snapshots. Deleting a service from the catalogue affects future session creation, but not historical sessions already stored on pets.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current PetLog state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous PetLog state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone PetLog state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialised with the initial PetLog state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single PetLog state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete oi/5` command to delete the 5th owner in PetLog. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of PetLog after the `delete oi/5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted PetLog state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `addowner on/David …​` to add a new owner. The `addowner` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified PetLog state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the PetLog state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the owner was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous PetLog state, and restores PetLog to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores PetLog to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest PetLog state, then there are no undone PetLog states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the state of PetLog, such as `list`, will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all PetLog states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `addowner on/David …​` command. This is the behaviour that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire state of PetLog.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Effort**

This section explains the difficulty level, challenges faced, effort required, and achievements of PetLog's development.

Difficulty level of our project: medium.

Compared to AB3, which primarily manages a single core entity type, our project required more effort because it supports **multiple related entity types**, namely owners, pets, services, and sessions. This introduced additional complexity in both the codebase and the product design, as we had to **maintain clear relationships** between these entities while **keeping commands intuitive** for users.

The main challenges faced were in extending the original owner-centric data model to **support nested pet records and session tracking**, ensuring that **commands remained consistent** despite operating on **different entity types**, and keeping the UI and documentation aligned with the evolving feature set. Features such as service-linked sessions and indexed operations on pets and sessions also required more careful handling than the original AB3 workflow.

The team spent about 10 hours per week over 5 weeks, for a team of 5. This gives an estimated overall effort of about 250 person-hours.

Our key achievements were redesigning the model to **support richer domain relationships**, implementing features for managing pets, services, and care sessions, and producing a coherent user guide and developer guide that reflect the current architecture and feature set.
