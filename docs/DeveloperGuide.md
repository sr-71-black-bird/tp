## **Acknowledgements**

* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org). We used the codebase as a starting point for our implementation of Owners.
* The Sessions feature was inspired by NUS CS2103/T Project Duke's [Level 7](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526-s2.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/projectDuke/index.html#level-7-save) and [Level 8](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526-s2.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/projectDuke/index.html#level-8-dates-and-times). A similar implementation was used in understanding user inputs as dates and times for our Sessions.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete oi/1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class, which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `OwnerListPanel`, `PetListPanel`, `SessionListPanel`, `ServiceListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person`, `Pet`, `Session`, and `Service` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete oi/1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddOwnerCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddOwnerCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddOwnerCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="650" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the PetLog data in an `AddressBook`, which contains all `Person` objects in a `UniquePersonList` and all `Service` objects in a `UniqueServiceList`.
* stores each owner's pets inside the corresponding `Person` object. Each `Pet` is made up of its own value objects such as `PetName`, `Species`, and `PetRemark`, and also owns its own list of `Session` objects.
* stores each `Session` as a time range with a fee and a list of associated `Service` objects, allowing one session to reference multiple services recorded in the `AddressBook`.
* stores the currently selected owners as a filtered list, exposed as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>`. This allows the UI to observe owner list changes and update automatically.
* derives and stores a separate filtered pet list, exposed as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Pet>`, so the UI can display pets in addition to the owner cards.
* derives and stores a displayed session list, exposed as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<SessionEntry>`. Each `SessionEntry` bundles a `Session` together with its owner and pet context for the UI.
* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPrefs` object.
* does not depend on the `UI`, `Logic`, or `Storage` components, since the `Model` represents the domain entities and their relationships.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It illustrates how `AddressBook` could store a shared `Tag` list that `Person` objects reference, instead of each `Person` storing its own `Tag` objects. This would reduce duplicate `Tag` instances across owners. For simplicity, the alternative diagram focuses only on the tag-related part of the model and omits the newer `Pet`, `Session`, and `Service` structures.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* exposes a unified `Storage` API that extends both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefsStorage`.
* is implemented by `StorageManager`, which delegates to `JsonAddressBookStorage` (PetLog data) and `JsonUserPrefsStorage` (user preferences).
* persists `ReadOnlyAddressBook` as JSON through `JsonSerializableAddressBook`, which uses Jackson-friendly adapters (`JsonAdaptedPerson`, `JsonAdaptedPet`, `JsonAdaptedSession`, `JsonAdaptedService`, `JsonAdaptedTag`) to convert between JSON and model types.
* preserves nested domain data when reading/writing: owners include pets, pets include sessions, and sessions include services; the address book also stores a top-level service list.
* returns `Optional.empty()` when data files are missing, and throws `DataLoadingException` when file contents are malformed or violate model constraints.
* is invoked by `LogicManager` to save the address book after each successful command, while user preferences are loaded/saved during app startup and shutdown in `MainApp`.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

These include indexes, exceptions and utility classes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Pet management

The pet feature is implemented by extending each `Person` with a `LinkedHashSet<Pet>`.

Key implementation points:
* `AddPetCommand` targets an owner from the current filtered owner list using `oi/`.
* Pet identity is checked per owner via `Person#hasPet(Pet)`, which compares pet name + species after normalisation (case-insensitive, whitespace-normalised).
* On successful `addpet`, the command rebuilds that owner with an updated pet set and applies it through `Model#setPerson(...)`.
* Pet remarks are updated through `update oi/... pi/... pr/...` (`UpdatePetRemarkCommand`), which edits the selected pet and writes the owner back via `Model#setPerson(...)`.
* The model also maintains a derived filtered pet list (`Model#getFilteredPetList`) so the UI can render pets directly without recalculating from owners.

### Service catalogue

Services are stored as a top-level catalog in `AddressBook` via `UniqueServiceList`.

Key implementation points:
* `addservice` validates service name/price through `ParserUtil` and `Service` constraints, then adds the service via `Model#addService(...)`.
* Service uniqueness is identity-based by normalised name (`Service#isSameService` / `Service#hasSameName`), so case/spacing variants are treated as duplicates.
* Price validation accepts only values from `0` to `10000` with up to 2 decimal places.
* `delete sn/...` removes a service by normalised name, and rejects mixed delete modes (e.g., owner index + service name in one command) at parser level.

### Session scheduling

Sessions are attached to pets (not stored as a top-level list), and each `Session` stores:
* a strict start time/end time (`yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`)
* a computed total fee
* an immutable list of selected services

Key implementation points:
* `addsession` resolves owner (`oi/`) and pet (`pi/`) from the current filtered owner list.
* Date/time parsing is strict (`Session#parseDateTime`), and end time must be after start time.
* Optional repeated `sn/` prefixes are allowed to attach multiple services from the service catalogue.
* Total session fee is computed from the sum of selected service prices.
* Overlap prevention is enforced per pet via `Pet#hasOverlappingSession(...)`; sessions that only touch at boundaries are allowed.
* `delete oi/... pi/... si/...` removes a session by index within that pet’s session list.
* The UI-facing session list is a derived projection (`SessionEntry`) rebuilt by `Model#updateDisplayedSessions(...)`, so `list`, `find`, `addsession`, and relevant `delete` operations keep the session panel synchronised with the current owner filter.

Design note:
* Existing sessions keep their own service snapshots. Deleting a service from the catalogue affects future session creation, but not historical sessions already stored on pets.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current PetLog state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous PetLog state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone PetLog state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialised with the initial PetLog state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single PetLog state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete oi/5` command to delete the 5th owner in PetLog. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of PetLog after the `delete oi/5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted PetLog state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add on/David …​` to add a new owner. The `addowner` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified PetLog state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the PetLog state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous PetLog state, and restores PetLog to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores PetLog to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest PetLog state, then there are no undone PetLog states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the state of PetLog, such as `list`, will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all PetLog states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add on/David …​` command. This is the behaviour that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire state of PetLog.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Effort**
Difficulty level of our project: medium.

Compared to AB3, which primarily manages a single core entity type, our project required more effort because it supports multiple related entity types, namely owners, pets, services, and sessions. This introduced additional complexity in both the codebase and the product design, as we had to maintain clear relationships between these entities while keeping commands intuitive for users.

The main challenges faced were in extending the original owner-centric data model to support nested pet records and session tracking, ensuring that commands remained consistent despite operating on different entity types, and keeping the UI and documentation aligned with the evolving feature set. Features such as service-linked sessions and indexed operations on pets and sessions also required more careful handling than the original AB3 workflow.

The team spent about 10 hours per week over 5 weeks, for a team of 5. This gives an estimated overall effort of about 250 person-hours.

Our key achievements were redesigning the model to support richer domain relationships, implementing features for managing pets, services, and care sessions, and producing a coherent user guide and developer guide that reflect the current architecture and feature set.
