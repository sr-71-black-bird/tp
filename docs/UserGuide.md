PetLog is a **desktop app for managing pet care operations**, optimised for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI)
while keeping the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface** (GUI).
With structured commands, it helps you manage, search and organize the details of owners and their pets efficiently. 
You can also add and keep track of the services you offer and also specific sessions where a pet will be receiving 
one of your services.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed on your computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `petlog.jar` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W14-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for PetLog.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and run `java -jar petlog.jar`.<br>
   A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing [`help`](#viewing-help-help) and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * [`list`](#listing-all-owners-list) : Lists all owners and pets.

   * [`addowner on/John Doe ph/98765432 em/johnd@example.com ad/John street, block 123, #01-01`](#adding-an-owner-addowner) : Adds an owner.

   * [`addpet oi/1 pn/Molly ps/Golden Retriever pr/cuddly`](#adding-a-pet-under-an-owner-addpet) : Adds a pet.

   * [`clear`](#clearing-all-owners-pets-services-and-sessions-clear) : Clears all owners, pets, services, and sessions.

   * [`exit`](#exiting-the-program-exit) : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in [`addowner on/OWNER_NAME`](#adding-an-owner-addowner), `OWNER_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as [`addowner on/John Doe`](#adding-an-owner-addowner).

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `on/OWNER_NAME [ot/TAG]` can be used as `on/John Doe ot/priority` or as `on/John Doe`.

* Items with `…​` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[ot/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `ot/friend`, `ot/friend ot/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `on/OWNER_NAME ph/PHONE_NUMBER`, `ph/PHONE_NUMBER on/OWNER_NAME` is also acceptable.

* Command words and prefixes are case-insensitive.<br>
  e.g. [`AdDoWnEr on/John Doe Ph/98765432 eM/j@example.com AD/123, Street`](#adding-an-owner-addowner) is accepted.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as [`help`](#viewing-help-help), [`list`](#listing-all-owners-list), [`exit`](#exiting-the-program-exit) and [`clear`](#clearing-all-owners-pets-services-and-sessions-clear)) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies [`help 123`](#viewing-help-help), it will be interpreted as [`help`](#viewing-help-help).

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Listing all owners: `list`

Shows a list of all owners and pets in PetLog.

Format: `list`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**

### Deleting an owner, pet, session or service: `delete`

`delete` has two usages with their own respective formats.

**1. Deleting an owner, pet or session**

Deletes the specified owner, pet or session from PetLog.

Format: `delete oi/OWNER_INDEX [pi/PET_INDEX [si/SESSION_INDEX]]`

* `OWNER_INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed owner list. It must be a positive integer.
* `PET_INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed pet list of the specified owner. It must be a positive integer.
* `SESSION_INDEX` index refers to the index number shown in the displayed session list of the specified pet. It must be a positive integer.
* Using `delete` with the `oi/` prefix only deletes the owner at `OWNER_INDEX`.
* Using `delete` with the `oi/` and `pi/` prefixes only deletes the pet at `PET_INDEX` of that owner.
* Using `delete` with the `oi/`, `pi/` and `si/` prefixes deletes the session at `SESSION_INDEX` of that pet.

Examples:
* `delete oi/4` deletes the 4th owner listed.
* `delete oi/4 pi/2` deletes the 2nd pet listed of the 4th owner.
* `delete oi/4 pi/2 si/3` deletes the 3rd session listed of the 2nd pet of the 4th owner.
* [`list`](#listing-all-owners-list) followed by `delete oi/2` deletes the 2nd owner listed.
* [`find on/Betsy`](#searching-for-owners-find) followed by `delete oi/1 pi/2` deletes the 2nd pet of the 1st owner in the results of the [`find`](#searching-for-owners-find) command.

**2. Deleting a service**

Deletes a service from the service catalogue.

Format: `delete sn/SERVICE_NAME`

* `SERVICE_NAME` must match an existing service in the service catalogue.

Examples:
* `delete sn/Ear Cleaning` deletes Ear Cleaning as a service from the list (if it exists).


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note about the `delete` formats:**<br>

Using a combination of both formats, e.g. `delete oi/1 sn/Ear cleaning`, is invalid and will not succeed.

</div>

### Clearing all owners, pets, services and sessions: `clear`

Deletes all owners, pets, services and sessions from PetLog.

Format: `clear`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Use `clear` to remove the sample data when you first run PetLog so you can start putting in your own!
</div>

### Exiting the program: `exit`

Exits PetLog.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

PetLog data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data, and upon exiting. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

PetLog data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/petlog.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, PetLog will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause PetLog to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my PetLog data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install PetLog on the other computer, and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data from your previous PetLog home folder.

**Q**: Why do indexes become invalid after I run [`find`](#searching-for-owners-find)?<br>
**A**: Indexes always refer to the current displayed list. After filtering, either use the new filtered indexes or run [`list`](#listing-all-owners-list) to reset the indexes, before deleting/updating.

**Q**: How do I clear a pet’s remark?<br>
**A**: Use an empty remark value: [`update oi/OWNER_INDEX pi/PET_INDEX pr/`](#updating-the-remarks-of-a-pet-update).

**Q**: Can I create a session without services?<br>
**A**: Yes. `sn/` is optional in [`addsession`](#adding-a-session-addsession). If no services are provided, the session fee is `0.00`.

**Q**: How is a session’s total fee calculated?<br>
**A**: It is the sum of all services provided in the [`addsession`](#adding-a-session-addsession) command, using the current service prices in PetLog.

**Q**: Why does [`addsession`](#adding-a-session-addsession) fail with “Unknown service”?<br>
**A**: At least one `sn/SERVICE_NAME` does not exist in your current service list. Add it first with [`addservice`](#adding-a-service-addservice), or correct the name.

**Q**: Where is my data stored, and how do I reset to sample data?<br>
**A**: Data is stored at `[JAR location]/data/petlog.json`. Back up that file to migrate data. To reset to sample data, delete `petlog.json` and restart the app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

1. **If you minimise the Help Window** and then run the [`help`](#viewing-help-help) command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimised, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimised Help Window.
